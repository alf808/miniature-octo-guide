# Evaluation of Nexpose and OpenVAS

## Summary
There are thousands of known security holes in networks, systems and applications. Scanning them for vulnerabilities can assist in detecting a company's exposure to security risks. Vulnerability scanners have made the tedious and tortuous process of discovering risks more manageable.

Two vulnerability scanners that I will be evaluating are Nexpose by Rapid7 and OpenVAS. Both will scan the same system with the Metasploitable virtual machine, an intentionally vulnerable Linux system.

Nexpose is made by Rapid7, the same company that created

## Installation

## Notes
openvas installation

Installation / setup were not as simple as openvas. It requires more resources to install, RAM and storage. It is also dependent on JRE. It is quite buggy and breaks easily. I had to install it 4 or 5 times after running a scan.

activation key is needed. Activation takes about 15 minutes. The whole installation setup and activation takes about 1 hour.
